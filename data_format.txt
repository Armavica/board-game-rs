data layout:

* 1 win   \
* 1 draw  all from POV of board.next 0,1
* 1 loss  /

* 81 move probability 0..1
* 81 move_mask 0/1

* 81 board.next tiles 0,1
* 81 board.next.other tiles 0,1

* 9 board.next macros 0,1
* 9 board.next.other macros 0,1

mask, move probability and tiles are all in o-order, not yx-order!
they need to be rearranged before being used as a 2D tensor
