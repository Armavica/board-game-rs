data layout:

game result:
* 3 final_wdl    0..1

mcts output:
* 3 pred_wdl     0..1
* 81 pred_policy 0..1

board state:
* 81 move_mask   0,1

* 81 board.next tiles 0,1
* 81 board.next.other tiles 0,1

* 9 board.next macros 0,1
* 9 board.next.other macros 0,1

all wdl from POV of board.next_player

mask, move probability and tiles are all in o-order, not yx-order!
they need to be rearranged before being used as a 2D tensor
